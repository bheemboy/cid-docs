## 1. Your Content & Your Permissions

When you use our Service, you provide us with things like your files, content, messages, etc. (“Your Content”). Your Content is yours. You represent that you have all necessary right, power, and authority to use the Service and share Your Content and will comply with all applicable laws when doing so. These AUP Guidelines don’t give us any rights to Your Content except for the limited rights that enable us to offer the Service as stated in the Terms of Use. Our right to use the Aggregated Data derived from use of the Services and Content which does not identify You is defined in the Terms of Use. We need your permission to do things like host Your Content, back it up, or share it when you ask us to. This permission extends to our trusted third parties we work with. You therefore give us, and third parties (with whom we work) permission to use, display, host, share, and back up Your Content. By submitting Your Content, you also permit us to identify you by your username and as the contributor of Your Content.

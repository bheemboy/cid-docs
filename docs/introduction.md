# Introduction

![CID image](./img/cid.jpg)

The **Agilent Connected Instrument Device (CID)** for **OpenLab CDS** is a pre-configured IoT solution that includes the OpenLab Instrument Controller software, drivers, and add-ons. OpenLab CDS client systems connect to the CID over the corporate network (intranet) to operate the attached instruments. Software configuration and management for the CID are centralized through a web application called **CID Hub**.

The **CID Hub** is an invitation-only web application. When an organization purchase CIDs, Agilent administrators create the organization's account and register the initial customer-side administrators. These initial admins will receive an email invitation from CID Hub \<no-reply@hub.cid.agilent.com\> to activate their accounts and set their initial passwords.

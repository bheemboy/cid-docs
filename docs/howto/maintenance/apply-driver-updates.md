# Update Drivers & Add-ons

As and when new drivers and add-ons are released, they are made available on the CID Hub. You can see which versions of drivers and add-ons are available on the CID Hub, by navigating to "Software Library" tab and then to the "Instrument Drivers" or the "Add-ons" sub section.

You can select the specific driver and add-on versions you want installed on your CIDs by choosing on the [software tab](/howto/define-software-template) of you server or on the [software tab](/howto/configure-software-exceptions) of your CID.

On the software page you will see the label "Update Available" against drivers for which newer version are available. You can click on change to see which newer versions are available and also view the release notes.

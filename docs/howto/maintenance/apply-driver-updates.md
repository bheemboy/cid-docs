You can choose which driver or add-on versions to install on your CIDs from the **Software** tab on either your [server](/howto/define-software-template) or an individual [CID](/howto/configure-software-exceptions).

On the Software page, the **Update Available** label appears for any driver that has a newer version.  
Select **Change** to view available versions and read their release notes.

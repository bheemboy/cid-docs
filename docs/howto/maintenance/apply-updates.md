# Apply Updates on one or more CIDs


You can choose to install these updates on each CID individually from the CID Software page. ALternatively, you can also install upadtes on multiple CIDs at the same time from the CID's List page. To do so, select the CIDs on which you want to install the updates and hit the Apply Updates (gear icon) button.

:::info
The **'Ready' value in Status column** indicates that the CID is ready for use (not in use). This state is ideal when installing updates. Other states like 'idle' and 'running' mean that CDS is running on the CID. Installing updates on a CID that is not in 'Ready' state could interfere with the running CDS, hence it is not recommended.

The **'Ready' value in Updates column** indicates that the updates are downloaded on the CID and are ready to be installed.

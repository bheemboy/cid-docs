# Update Drivers & Add-ons

New drivers or add-ons are published to the CID Hub when they are released.

To view the available versions, go to the **Software Library** tab, then open the **Instrument Drivers** or **Add-ons** sections.

You can choose which driver or add-on versions to install on your CIDs from the **Software** tab on either your [**server**](/howto/define-software-template) or an individual [**CID**](/howto/configure-software-exceptions).

On the Software page, the **Update Available** label appears for any driver that has a newer version.  
Select **Change** to view available versions, read release notes, and select them to be installed.

After making your selections, you can [**apply the changes**](apply-updates) to your CID(s).

## 2. SERVICES

### a. Access to and use of the Software

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, Agilent grants Customer a non-exclusive and non-transferable license to access and use the Software and Documentation within Customer's Permitted Use.

### b. Authorized Users

Customer may only allow Authorized Users to access and use the Software and Documentation. An Authorized User may not share its right to use with other users. Customer will not make available, directly or indirectly, by any technical means, the Software or the Documentation accessible to other users than the Authorized Users. The actual number of Authorized Users may never exceed the number of Authorized Users authorized by Agilent. Customer shall ensure that all Authorized Users are made aware of and agree to comply with the terms of this Agreement. Customer is solely responsible for Customer Content and the use of the Services by the Authorized Users.

Customer agrees that:
* (a) it shall maintain the confidentiality and security of passwords,
* (b) it shall obtain from Authorized Users any consents necessary to allow Agilent to provide the Services, and
* (c) use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized access to or use of the Services, and notify Agilent promptly of any such unauthorized use or access.

Customer shall not (and shall not permit Authorized Users to):
* (a) sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, distribute, or otherwise transfer or provide access to the Services to any person, firm, or entity except as expressly authorized herein, access the Services to build a competitive service or product, or copy any feature, function or graphic for competitive purposes;
* (b) modify, adapt, alter or create derivative works from the Services or to merge the Services or any subpart thereof (including proprietary markings) with other services or software, or remove or modify any proprietary markings or restrictive legends in the Services.

### c. Availability and Interruption

The following factors may affect the availability of the Software:
* (i) the suspension or termination of the Agreement;
* (ii) circumstances outside of Agilent's reasonable control, including but not limited to any force majeure event;
* (iii) any actions or inactions of Customer, or any other third party;
* (iv) any problems with the Internet, Customer's infrastructure, Customer's equipment, Customer's software or other technology and/or third party's infrastructure, equipment or software (other than third party's equipment within Agilent's direct control).

### d. Location, Storage and Backup of Data

The Software will operate through the Internet in an application service provider (ASP) mode. Every CID Hub device uses APIs to access a shared AWS database. Customers are not allowed to connect to the database. The database is only accessible from within the cloud environment's private network, and it is not publicly accessible from the internet. The database uses the available automatic backup option of AWS to store encrypted backups.

### e. Support and Maintenance

Throughout the term, Agilent shall provide the Customer with access updates and software fixes that are developed and generally incorporated into the standard release of the Service available to its customers against no charge. Agilent retains sole discretion in defining what functionality constitutes an improvement versus an upgrade constituting new module or version (offered at additional cost).

### f. Scheduled Maintenance

**Scheduled Maintenance** typically occurs during the periods of low anticipated system usage, currently between 12:00am and 8:00am Eastern U.S. Time. During Scheduled Maintenance, certain components of the CID Hub may be offline, or may be operating in less redundant modes, or may be operating at reduced capacity levels, while maintenance is performed. Agilent will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Customer via website postings of Scheduled Maintenance at least **24 hours** in advance.

### g. CID Hub Release Cycles

Agilent may release updated versions of CID Hub multiple times per year, with each new major version indicated by a new major version number. Every CID release has a three-digit version number. The first two digits indicate the major version number, the last digit indicates the patch number. The initial release of the new version is for example called **5.1.0**. Then, the next patch release which includes some bug fixes would be called **5.1.1**. After the initial release of a major version, bug fixes are delivered in subsequent patch releases for the major version. Patch releases are created as appropriate. Bugs are defined as unwanted deviations between the implemented functionality and the designed functionality.

### h. Product feature request

This category allows customers to bring potential additions to the functionality of the CID Hub to Agilent's attention. The composition and timing of the CID Hub feature roadmap remains at all times the sole responsibility of Agilent, and no guarantee is given that suggested new features will be included in the product.

### i. System Availability

Agilent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide at least **99% System Availability** in any given year (with unavailability excluding those periods in which Agilent is performing Scheduled Maintenance, or in which there is a Service Credit Exclusion (as defined in Service Credit Exclusions)).

### j. Service Credits

In the event that Agilent does not meet the System Availability Customer shall be entitled to service credits, in accordance with Table 1 at the end of these Terms of Use. The Service Credits will be applied as a deduction to the Customer from Agilent on the next payment due. Service Credits may not be transferred or applied to any other Agilent account. Customer's sole and exclusive remedy for any unavailability or nonperformance of Services is a Service Credit (if eligible). The maximum cumulative amount for all applicable Service Credits in a year is **100%** of the portion of that year's total contract fee for the affected Services paid by the Customer.

### k. System Availability Monitoring

System Availability is validated at least every **5 minutes**. If the system is not available for three consecutive checks, or if Agilent or its partners become aware that user-initiated requests are unsuccessful, Agilent will escalate problem resolution.

### l. Calculation of Service Credits and Payment Procedures

Agilent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to monitor System Availability to determine, on an annual basis, if Customer is entitled to Service Credits. If Customer believes that it is entitled to Service Credits, Customer may submit a credit request by sending an e-mail to Agilent. If Agilent determines that Customer is entitled to Service Credits, then Agilent will issue Service Credits to Customer on the next payment due.

### m. Service Credit Exclusions

The System Availability service level does not apply to, and no Service Credits are available to Customer as a result of any unavailability, suspension, or termination of a Service (each, a **Service Credit Exclusion**) caused by:
* (i) factors outside Agilent's reasonable control, including any Force Majeure event,
* (ii) that result from actions or inactions of the Customer or any third party,
* (iii) that result from other non-Agilent equipment, software or technology, including but not limited to any software or hardware that interferes with Customer's CID Hub such as Wi-Fi, firewall, etc.,
* (iv) Scheduled Maintenance, or
* (v) that result from a Service suspension or termination of the Customer's right to use the Service in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.

## Table 1. Service Credits

| Service Level Name | Calculation | Annual Minimum Service Level | Service Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **System Availability** | Annual System Availability equals Unscheduled Downtime divided by Scheduled Service Uptime for that year. Example: In a 365 day year Scheduled Service Uptime may be 525,600 minutes, if there were 1,000 minutes of Unscheduled Downtime then the System Availability for that year would be 99.809% (calculated as follows: $\frac{524,600}{525,600}=99.809\%$). | The service level for annual System Availability is **99%**. | If System Availability for a year is less than 99%, Customer shall be entitled to a Service Credit equivalent to the amount of unscheduled service downtime in excess of 0.1%, divided by the amount of Scheduled Service Uptime for that year, and multiplied by the portion of the total recurring fee for that year for the affected Services payable by Customer. The maximum cumulative credit for any and all applicable Service Credits in a year is **100%** of the portion of the total recurring fee for that year for the affected Services payable by Customer. |
